What is it
==========

A Pygments' Lexer implementation for the Litil language. What do you mean by what is the Litil language ? Why it's a toy language I've been working on for the last few weeks. You really never heard of it before ? Weird ...

Oh, and this lexer is a blatant rip-off of the OCaml Lexer that comes with the Pygments package.

# Installation

Checkout and *easy_install* it:

    $ git clone git://github.com/jawher/litil-pygments.git
    $ cd litil-pygments
    $ easy_install .

# Usage

This package activates the syntax highlighting for the `*.ltl` files and with the name `litil`.
